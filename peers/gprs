# Name: gprs
# Purpose: GPRS PPPD Connection Script
# Notes: This is a detailed connection script for using GPRS devices as a tethered modem when connected via Bluetooth, Serial or USB.
# See PPPD man pages for more info.
#
# Most GPRS devices will not reply to LCP echo's
lcp-echo-failure 0
lcp-echo-interval 0
#
# Specify 'nodetach' to allow PPPD to run interactively rather than as a background daemon.
nodetach
#
# Used to create a debug log.
# Comment this out once the PPP configuration is connecting successfully.
debug
#
# Show password in debug messages.
show-password
#
# Connect Script: CHAT is used to issue modem connect commands.
connect "/usr/sbin/chat -v -V -S -s -t3 -f /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-connect-chat"
#
# Disconnect Script: CHAT is used to issue modem disconnect commands.
disconnect /etc/ppp/peers/gprs-disconnect-chat
#
# Specify which device to use.  By default this dynamically maps to devices created in /dev/modem but can be adjusted as necessary.
#/dev/modem
/dev/ttyUSB0
# /dev/ttyS0 # Serial Port 1 (COM1 in Windows)
# /dev/ttyS1 # Serial Port 2 (COM2 in Windows)
# /dev/ircomm0 # IrDA Serial Port
# /dev/ttyUSB0 # USB Serial device
# /dev/rfcomm0 # Bluetooth Serial Port 1
# /dev/rfcomm1 # Bluetooth Serial Port 2
#
# Set the LOCAL serial port line speed.  This does NOT affect GPRS connection speed.
#57600 # Some IrDA devices don't run full-duplex and this speed must be used.
115200 # GPRS and EDGE Devices.
#230400 # UMTS devices.
#460800 # HSDPA UMTS devices.
#
# Hardware flow control should be used with most devices.
crtscts # Use for Serial, BlueTooth and USB devices.
#nocrtscts # Use for IrDA devices.
#
# Add the PPP interface as the default route to the IP routing table.

#
# PPP compression options.
# These are specific to the serial connection, not the GPRS connection.

#
# Defines whether an attempt should be made to re-establish a dropped GPRS connection.

#
# Defines the maximum number of reconnect attempts to try.

#
# Ignore carrier detect signal from the modem.
# local
#
# This advises the PPP accept peers idea of our local address and sets address peer as 10.0.0.1.
# Any address will do since IPCP assigns 0.0.0.0 to it.
# PPPD may reject this if you are using the 10.x.x.x range on another interface.
# :10.0.0.1
#
# Advises PPPD to request any DHCP address, none in particular.
# noipdefault
#
# Allows the PPPD daemon to accept DHCP assigned IPs.
# ipcp-accept-local
#
# Advises PPPD to use the DNS provided by DHCP.  Commonly causes "Received bad configure-nak/rej" errors when used.
# usepeerdns
#
# Used to disable authentication when establishing PDP context.
# If a custom PDP requires authentication, comment this out and provide the correct username below and update the username-password combination to the secrets file: /etc/ppp/pap-secrets (for PAP) or /etc/ppp/chap-secrets (for CHAP).
# See the PPPD man pages for further information.
# user "username"
#
# Asyncmap - Some devices may require this.
# asyncmap 0xa0000
#
# With the 'nomagic' option, PPPD cannot detect a looped-back line.
# Uncomment this only if the PPPD connection is buggy.
# nomagic
#
# Require the peer authenticate itself using PAP - Some devices may require this.
